# Dynamic Form Generator with React, React Hook Form, and Yup Validation

This project is a dynamic form generator built with **React**, using **react-hook-form** for form state management and validation, and **Yup** for defining dynamic validation rules. The form structure and validation rules are defined in a JSON object and rendered dynamically based on the input configuration. 

This setup is powered by **Vite** for fast development and build times and is written in **TypeScript** to ensure type safety.

## Features

- Dynamically generate form fields (text, email, number, checkbox, and select fields).
- Validation rules (required, maxLength, min, max, and regex patterns) are defined dynamically based on a JSON structure.
- Built-in error handling and display of validation error messages.
- Fast build and development environment using Vite.
- Written in TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
